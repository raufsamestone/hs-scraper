# HS - Web Scraper ðŸ¥·

Using **puppeteer** and **puppeteer-extra** for BOT issues.

I don't parse either persons or actual Linkedin URL's, because main object is scraping and referancing from two different sources.

## Install ðŸ“€

Copy your env file:

`cp .env.example .env`

Run:

`yarn && yarn steal`

This will export the elements as a **JSON** to `/results` folder, it tooks ~2-3 min.
